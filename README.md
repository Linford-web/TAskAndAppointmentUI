# TaskAndAppointmentUI
This is a simple Android application in android studio using java programming language. 
The application is includes a Task management system that eases the tedious work involved in the allocation of simple tasks by lecturers and allowing students to view and mark tasks as done. 
Appointments are a major problem when it comes to seeing the lecturers and school staff. The application solves the problem by allowing lecturers to create available time when they have time to meet up with students and other Staff, Students are able to view what time the specified Lecturer has time to have a meeting.
The project is a highlight of the several User Interfaces that the project will incorporate to completion.
It provides a solid road map to developmetn of a fully functional Task and Appointment management Application.
